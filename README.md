As the demand for high-speed data in wireless communications increases day by 
day with the significant increase of the number of users, Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum become one 
of the scantest resources in the world. RF technologies have limitations of the regulated spectrum, 
spectrum congestion. expensive licensing, low bandwidth and low bandwidth and low-speed 
broadband connection. So the new wireless technology known as light fidelity (Li-Fi) has become a new 
source for communication of data. expensive licensing, low bandwidth and low bandwidth and lowspeed broadband connection. So the new wireless technology known as light fidelity (Li-Fi) has become
